Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) More than one drug may be reported per death. These are mentions of each drug, and should not be added to give total deaths. Up to 2007, some pathologists reported only those drugs which they thought caused, or contributed to, the death. From 2008, they report separately:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(a) drugs which were implicated in, or which potentially contributed to the cause of death; and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(b) other drugs which were present but which were not considered to have had any direct contribution to the death.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The figures for 2008 onwards are on the first basis - i.e. basis (a) - which became the normal basis for figures for individual drugs with effect from ""Drug-related Deaths in Scotland in 2009'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There may be other differences between years and/or areas in the way in which the information was produced - more information can be found in Section 2 of the commentary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2) More information can be found in paragraph 3.3.1 of the commentary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) The distinction between ""prescribable"" and ""street"" benzodiazepines is as specified by the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland (which is now part of Public Health Scotland) - see Annex H.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
