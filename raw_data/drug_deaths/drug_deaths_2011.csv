"Table CX: Drug-related deaths by selected drugs reported1 and Council area, 2011",,,,,,,,,,

"Deaths in which particular drugs were involved, counted on the 'All Drugs Present' basis.",,,,,,,,,,
"So, this table counts both:",,,,,,,,,,
"(a) drugs implicated in, or which potentially contributed to, the cause of death; and",,,,,,,,,,
"(b) other drugs which were present, but were not considered to have had any direct contribution to the death,",,,,,,,,,,

so these figures are not on the standard basis that National Records of Scotland (NRS) uses to produce statistics of individual drugs.,,,,,,,,,,

Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,
"1) More than one drug may be reported per death. These are mentions of each drug, and should not be added to give total deaths.  ",,,,,,,,,,
"Up to 2007, some pathologists reported only those drugs which they thought caused, or contributed to, the death.",,,,,,,,,,
"With effect from 2008, pathologists report separately (a) drugs which were implicated in, or which potentially contributed to, the cause of death and (b) other drugs which were present but were not considered to have had any direct contribution to the death.  ",,,,,,,,,,
Basis (a) is now the standard basis for figures for individual drugs.,,,,,,,,,,
The figures in this table are for all drugs found present - i.e. cover both (a) and (b) - so are not on the standard basis for igures for individual drugs.,,,,,,,,,,
"While they are on the same basis as the 'individual drugs' figures that were published in 'Drug-related Deaths in Scotland in 2008', they are not on the same basis as the figures published in the 2009 and 2010 editions (which include some revised figures for individual drugs for 2008).",,,,,,,,,,
"There may be other differences between years and/or areas in the way in which the information was produced - further information can be found in Section 2 of Drug-related Deaths in Scotland in 2011, available on the National Records of Scotland (NRS) website.",,,,,,,,,,
2) More information can be found in paragraph 3.3.1 of the commentary.,,,,,,,,,,
