# Public Health in Scotland - Dashboard Project

###### Created as part of the Professional Data Analysis course at CodeClan by Tom Davie, Lee McDonald & Melanie Jayasinghe. In this group project we spent approximately 4 days developing this dashboard and supplementary documentation. It concluded in presenting our work to an audience. 

We created a dashboard to highlight the growing drug crisis and the staggering increase in drug deaths in recent years in Scotland.
